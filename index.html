          <h1>Where friends code together, turning ideas into reality.</h1>
          <p>
            At SEAIT, a bunch of us IT students, led by Keyan Andy Delgado,
            decided to team up and call ourselves BarkaDevs. We all really like
            learning about web development, and Keyan helps us figure things
            out. We're like a group of friends who enjoy working together on
            coding projects, staying up late to solve problems and turn our
            ideas into actual websites.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            As a team, we take pride in turning lines of code into tangible
            websites, not only for academic excellence but also for the joy of
            creating something meaningful. BarkaDevs is more than just a group
            of IT students â€“ it's a community that thrives on collaboration,
            friendship, and the shared passion for making technology work for
            us. Joining BarkaDevs means joining a story of learning, growing,
            and enjoying the exciting challenges that come with being IT
            students at SEAIT.
